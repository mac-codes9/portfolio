    I am an experienced developer with over 3 years of experience. Currently
    honing my skills in NextJS, Typescript, and other cutting-edge technologies.
    I am also learning developer tools and systems programming with Rust and Zig.

    In addition to my passion for programming, I also enjoy exploring the world of
    music composition and challenging myself with skateboard tricks whenever
    I'm not recovering from an injury.
